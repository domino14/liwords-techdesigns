# Purpose

A few sentences about the purpose of this design.

# Background

A paragraph or two with more background information about what prompted this design.

# Glossary of terms

For any abbreviations, etc. This design will not necessarily be read only by engineers.

# Technical Design

The meat about what has to be done, architecture diagrams, what will change, which components/services are involved, etc.

This should probably be the largest part of the design.

# Implementation Plan

A list of the “user stories” / tickets that are going to be created. Ideally these tickets can be copied straight into Github Issues for us to work on. 

# Appendix

Any other diagrams, etc that can help elucidate anything better
